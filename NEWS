Snd 9.1


peak-env-hook
draw-mix-hook

background-gradient (gtk+cairo only)
sound-mark-info

moved equalize-panes to snd-motif.scm

in cmn: 
  Michael Edwards added a way to change a staff name (new-staff-name)
  I did half of the :old-style layout bugfix (the staves are laid out correctly, I think, but first-staff clefs are omitted)

in clm:
  changes for ACL 8.1

SIGUSR1 (kill -10) throws Snd back to its top level -- a way, perhaps, to get out
  of any infinite loop.


Thanks!: Michael Edwards, Etienne Deleflie, Joshua Parmenter
