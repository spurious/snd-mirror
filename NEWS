Snd 7.8:

new version of gfm package (sndlib/gfm) thanks to Mike Scholz,
  now included (along with sndins) in the Snd tarball.
  also many other improvements

various bugfixes and improvements thanks to Kjetil S. Matheussen

added:
  recorder-in-chans
  vct->string
  normalize-channel
  controls->channel
  sound-data->sound-data (for oscope)
  rms-envelope in env.scm (based on Bret Battey's rmsenv.ins)
  edit history pane popup menu (popup.scm and gtk-popup.scm) (unfinished)

  oscope.scm: oscilloscope dialog

removed:
  track-id arg to mix-selection
  edpos arg to play-selection
  mus_audio_save|restore (audio.c) and Scheme/Ruby correlates
  the dumb buttons at the bottom of the controls (Apply etc)
    these are now in various popup menus

moved scale-sound-by and scale-sound-to to snd7.scm.

changed handling of recorder-out-chans -- it now sets the max out chans
  displayed in the recorder dialog, as well as the default output file chans.

checked: gtk 2.5.4|5, sbcl 0.8.16, ruby 1.8.2-preview3
