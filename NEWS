Snd 14.7.

s7: sort! now operates in-place on lists (it used to copy the list).
    sort! also accepts bytevectors (for r7rs), and as a by-product, strings.
    string-up|downcase built-in (for r7rs).
    stuff.scm.
    cyclic-sequences.
    hash-table-entries.

Snd: removed defvar (use define-envelope), and multiply-arrays (missed earlier)

checked: sbcl 1.1.18|1.2.0, gtk 3.13.1|2
