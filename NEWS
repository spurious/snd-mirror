Bill Sack's pd-stochastic.scm and snd-stochastic.pd.

more pd-related improvements, thanks to Kjetil.

more ruby and emacs related improvements thanks to Mike.

in clm, numerous sbcl-related bugfixes thanks to Fernando.

new-sound-dialog.

removed ancient SGI-specific useScheme resource

removed XmMultiList from xm module

alsa: changed environment variable names to use MUS_* rather than SNDLIB_*
      changed default alsa device to "default", but it then looks for "plughw:0" 
            and "hw:0" if things seem weird. 
      added mus-alsa-playback-device, mus-alsa-capture-device, mus-alsa-device,
            mus-alsa-buffers, mus-alsa-buffer-size, mus-alsa-squelch-warning.

changed mus-audio-sun-outputs to mus-sun-set-outputs, and
        mus-audio-set-oss-buffers to mus-oss-set-buffers
added mus-netbsd-set-outputs

mus-file-data-clipped -> mus-clipping, added mus-file-clipping for local settings
  data-clipped -> clipping
  mus-prescaler (global) alongside previous mus-file-prescaler

added pausing -- returns #t if DAC is paused, can be set to #t or #f to start/stop pausing
  similarly playing -- #t if DAC is running (may be paused), settable to start/stop playing
  removed dac-is-running (it's in snd7.scm)
  (eventually I'd like to get rid of the jargon "DAC", but that involves 5 more names)

with-tracking-cursor and with-verbose-cursor as synonyms for cursor-follows-play and verbose-cursor
  tracking-cursor-style

bind-key now takes a character or string 1st arg (as well as an integer); if a string, it's treated
  as the X/Gtk key name (e.g. "Home" or "plus").  It also has a 6th optional arg, a preferences
  dialog name (so that the dialog can reflect current key bindings by functionality).


checked: clisp 2.38 (cmn), fftw 3.1, gtk 1.8.11|12|13, sbcl 0.9.9, MacIntel, guile 1.8.0
