s7: make-hash-table-iterator.

    map and for-each accept any applicable object as the first argument.

    format's ~{...~} directive can handle any applicable object.

    the thread stuff has been exported to s7.h.

    s7_set_begin_hook (see s7.html#s7inathread and s7.html#replrescue)
      The basic problem is that the GUI toolkits are not thread-safe, but we
      want the GUI to remain responsive even if s7 is caught in an infinite
      loop in the listener.  This also gives a way to break out of any long
      computation without relying on Unix signals and weird keystrokes.
      This is tied to C-g in the listener, so ws-interrupt (ws.scm) is
      now a deprecated no-op.

lots more forth and ruby stuff thanks to Mike Scholz.
