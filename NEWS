Snd 7.6

Most of the work in this period went into clm-3, but there were some
changes to Snd:

  numerous improvements and bugfixes from Kjetil Matheussen, including the
    snd-ls package.

  added mixer-scale, mixer+, make-scalar-mixer, continue-frame->file
    run-safety, clm-table-size (filling in a few CLM gaps, making the
    Scheme version of with-sound the same as the CL version)

  new run-time function args to phase-vocoder and granulate (and run support)

  channel-distance in dsp.scm

  configure switches: 
    --with-midi            include midi.o (sndlib midi module), default: no
    --with-hobbit          include arity check support for hobbit, default: no
    --with-builtin-gtkrc   include built-in fallback gtkrc, default: yes

  out-chan argument to add-player so that channel data can be sent to any audio channel
    (also play, play-and-wait, play-channel, play-mono-as-stereo example in extsnd.html)
    added players (a list of currently active players)

  new tools directory with various Snd development scripts
   
  forward/back buttons on the help dialog

  removed built-in Hadamard transform

Checked: Fedora Core 2, gsl 1.5, gtk 2.4.4/2.5.0/2.5.1, Ruby 1.8.2, sbcl 0.8.12/0.8.13
  also many changes reflecting those in recent versions of Guile
