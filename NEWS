Snd 14.8:

s7: symbol-table function now returns a list of all known symbols.
    require added
    removed unoptimize and reader-expand
    Display macro in stuff.scm
    added ~< expr ~> in format as a sort of "here-string" escape -- any s7 code in
      the brackets is evaluated in the current environment, and the result
      is inserted at that point in the output string (using object->string if
      the result is not a string). This is similar to {var} or $var in various
      shell languages. 
    also added ~| as a smarter ~^
    for all output functions, #f as port means no output (/dev/null in effect)

Snd: the numbering for dialog-widgets has changed -- the unused entries were removed.

checked: sbcl 1.2.1, gtk 3.13.3

Thanks!: Greg Santucci
