Snd 22.5:

s7: add vector-type to return or set the type checking part of the vector element setter,
    and similarly hash-table-key-typer and hash-table-value-typer

checked: sbcl 2.2.5|6
  new ghostscript is unhappy with cmn eps files; version 9.55 is unhappy, 
  9.52 is happy.  I think this is caused by negative origin bounding boxes 
  which have worked fine for 30 years.


Thanks!: Woody Douglass, Michael Mees, Elijah Stone
