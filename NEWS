Snd 14.4: 

Mike Scholz updated sndins.c.

s7: changed lambda* arg handling slightly to mimic CL.
    added when and unless (for r7rs; these were macros).

CLM: Frank Zalkow donated lw-all.lisp.

checked: gtk 3.11.4|5, sbcl 1.1.15.

Thanks!: Rick, Mike, Frank Zalkow, James Hearon.


Just a progress report, some timings:

  version     12.x  13.0  14.4

  snd-test     359   275  39.7  (no gui)
  s7test      1721  1358   974  (hard to optimize)
  make-index 44300  3291  1382  (hooray for char-position)
  t455|6       265    89   5.2  (the s7.html torture tester)
  t502          90    43  13.6  (pure clm)
  bench      42736  8752  3447  (the standard Gabriel tests)
  lat          229    63  30.4  (bad-old-style academistry)

These are callgrind numbers.  Currently if you're running the 
gtk Snd, nearly all the time is going to gtk and cairo (mainly, 
I think, to their allocation functions).
