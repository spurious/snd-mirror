Snd 11.12

s7: *gc-stats*
    member and assoc have an optional 3rd arg, the comparison function
    added environment?

in the gtk 3 version of Snd, there is no longer a -nogtkrc flag, and
    Snd.gtkrc is obsolete (Gtk has moved to a css-style system, but I
    think in gtk 3 I'll leave all the "theme" stuff to the global theme).
    
    in gtk2, only versions 2.10 or later are supported.

checked: gtk 2.91.5|6|7, sbcl 1.0.45

Thanks!: Mike Scholz
