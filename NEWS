Snd 10.5

many more improvements thanks to Kjetil and Mike Scholz.

multidimensional and applicable vectors in s7.

pulseaudio support (--with-pulseaudio in configure): 
  I don't know if this actually works, since pulseaudio (paplay) itself
  doesn't work on my machine. 

moved the papoulis and dpss (slepian) fft-windows from dsp.scm to clm.c.
  added sinc-window.

matlab mat-5 headers (for 1-channel sound data).

all hash literals using ',' changed to use '=>' in *.rb (for ruby 1.9.*)
  but ruby 1.9.n is not usable yet -- it segfaults on any error.
  Use strace to find out where the problem is.

checked: mpfr 2.4.1, gtk 2.15.5|16.0, fftw 3.2.1, fth 1.2.3, sbcl 1.0.27

Thanks!: Michael Edwards, Kjetil, Mike Scholz, Al Steffens, Anders Vinjar,
