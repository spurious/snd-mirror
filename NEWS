Snd 8.5

many improvements thanks to Kjetil and Mike.

gl2ps support, gl-graph->ps function, --with-gl2ps switch, gl2ps.[ch]

added gtk-effects-utils.scm, gtk support for *-menu.scm.

finally implemented the log-frequency display in non-GL spectrograms.

save-marks changed to keep matching sync values
add-mark now takes new optional trailing args: name and sync

removed the gtk_print stuff from xg.c since it's all useless without
  support for the cairo graphics functions and the pango functions
  that access them.

sounds->segment-data (examp.scm) -- returns segment start/dur/maxamp data for collections
  of sounds.

with-file-monitor -- can be set to #f to turn off the FAM process stuff.

add-watcher and delete-watcher -- this is a simpler (and less accident-prone)
  hook to catch any change to the sound list, the current selection, or the mark list; 
  it is intended to replace the multi-hook kludges currently used to set dialog button
  sensitivity, for example.  Since each watcher is identified by a unique integer,
  local (unnamed) functions can easily be deleted and so on.

  removed selection-changed-hook (use simpler watcher mechanism instead).

in cmn, thickness message now affects bars locally.  Added *double-barline-thickness*.

checked: gtk-2.10.4|5|6, sbcl 0.9.17, clisp 2.40|1.
