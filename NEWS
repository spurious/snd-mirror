Snd 10.4

(this is mostly a "clean up loose ends" version)


Kjetil made improvements to the pd external support, and made
       a port of CMN to ABCL.

big-gens.scm (scheme-only versions of some of the built-in generators)

changed spectro-cutoff to spectrum-end and spectro-start to spectrum-start
  moved the 10 spectro-* keypad key bindings to snd10.scm (keypad-spectro-bindings)
  moved the spectrum end slider to the transform dialog and added spectrum start slider
    (this should make it easier to zoom into an arbitrary portion of the spectrum)

merged the color and orientation dialogs

removed TODO.Snd, snd.spec, and old-snd.spec -- I don't plan to make any more rpm files.

checked: gsl 1.12, gtk 2.15.1|2|3|4, sbcl 1.0.25, cmucl 19f

Thanks!: Kjetil, Pavel Penev, Rick Taube, Michael Edwards, Mike Scholz
