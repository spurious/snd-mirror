Snd 13.9:

sndlib now can be built by premake4, thanks to Rick.

added --with-audio switch to sndlib configure script.
  innumerable other changes to the configure stuff in snd, sndlib, libxm, clm.
  old switch --with-no-gui is now --without-gui.
  removed --with-just-gl, --enable-readline, snd-as-widget, 
          --with-motif-prefix and --with-ruby-prefix.
  Gtk is now the default GUI toolkit, not Motif.

  added make-config-pc.rb to Snd/tools, sndlib, libxm
    this is a script Mike Scholz wrote to create a ruby.pc file if
    your Ruby package omitted it by mistake.

  cload.scm: changed define-c-function to c-define.
  added libm.scm to dynamically load the math library functions.
        libgdbm.scm to load the gdbm library.
        libdl.scm for libdl.
        tools/gdb-s7.scm: some unfinished gdb hackery.

removed trap-segfault.

ported Snd to OpenIndiana (solaris).

checked: gtk 3.9.6|8|10, sbcl 1.1.9|10, gl2ps 1.3.8, Linux Mint 15 (Debian),
	 gsl 1.16.

Thanks!: Nando, Rick, Mike, Orm Finnendahl.
