Snd 7.7

new version of sndins and other bugfixes thanks to Mike Scholz

in clm: autoc.ins, scentroid.ins, rmsenv.ins, and sndwarp.ins thanks to Bret Battey

clm: configuration and signum bugfixes thanks to Anders Vinjar


added: smart-line-cursor in draw.scm
	  (a line cursor that ducks under the top right thumbnail graph)

       vct|channel|spectral-polynomial (dsp.scm)

       create-ssb-dialog in snd-motif.scm 

       vct-reverse! (mostly to experiment with fancy granulate edit funcs)

       log-freq-start (with more transform dialog widgetry and axis improvements)

       show-sonogram-cursor (tracking cursor in sonogram)

       do? (examp.scm -- do that can be interrupted and continued)

       grid-density (controls axis tick spacing)

       edit-list->function (1st step toward a "sound spreadsheet")


removed: mus-inspect, buffer generator.
           (mus-inspect duplicates the functionality of mus-describe, and given
	   a decent debbuger, the extra info it provides is unneeded).

         vct-convolve! (see snd7.scm -- was same as convolution function)

         vct->samples and samples->vct (see snd7.scm)
	   (These were redundant given vct->channel->vct and inconsistent with others)

         list and vector return value choices from map-chan and map-channel (see snd7.scm).
           float vector as possible arg to formant-bank, fft, or scale-* (use vct) (see snd7.scm).
           list of vectors as possible arg to graph (use list of vcts)
           mus-audio-mixer-read|write vector arg is now a vct
           (I'm trying to reduce the use of vectors as much as possible)

         oscil-bank, mus-bank (see snd7.scm)

         support for gtkglext 0.1 through 0.4


changed transform-samples->vct to transform->vct, region-samples->vct to region->vct,
	transform-samples-size to transform-frames. (Old forms are in snd7.scm).

checked: gtk 2.5.2|3, Mesa 6.1, sbcl 0.8.14|5

with much help from: Michael Klingbeil, Anthony Kozar, Bret Battey, Anders Vinjar, 
     Mike Scholz, Paul Winkler, Marv Smoak


(Snd has lumbered over the 400,000 line mark -- 250000 C, 110000 Scheme,
30000 Ruby, and a few thousand of m4, lisp, emacs-lisp etc)
