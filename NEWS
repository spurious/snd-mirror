Snd 8.7

a huge number of *.fs and *.rb improvements from Mike, including the
  new file bird.fsm.


added frame.scm with:

    frame-reverse! frame-copy (from mixer.scm)
    sound->frame frame->sound 
      region->frame
   
    make-frame-reader frame-reader? frame-reader-at-end frame-reader-position 
      frame-reader-home free-frame-reader copy-frame-reader frame-reader-chans
      next-frame previous-frame read-frame
      make-region-frame-reader make-selection-frame-reader 
      make-track-frame-reader read-track-frame make-sync-frame-reader
   
    frame->sound-data sound-data->frame
    sound->sound-data sound-data->sound
      region->sound-data track->sound-data selection->sound-data
    file->vct vct->file
    frame->vct vct->frame
    file->sound-data sound-data->file

    insert-sound-data insert-frame insert-vct
    mix-sound-data mix-frame
    scan-sound map-sound (this replaces 8.6's scan-sound)

    simultaneous-zero-crossing

added to extensions.scm:
    pad-sound contrast-sound dither-sound scale-sound offset-sound normalize-sound 

added to examp.scm:
    compand-sound sync-all

sound-data-multiply! sound-data-add! sound-data-offset! sound-data* sound-data+ 
    sound-data-copy sound-data-reverse! sound-data-peak

region-home
add-source-file-extension

clip-hook: called whenever we're about to clip while writing a sound file
  unclip-channel (dsp.scm) based on LPC (reconstruction via forward and backward prediction)
  lpc-coeffs and lpc-predict in dsp.scm
  io.c:  mus_clip_set_handler

finally decided to build in the definition of pi in Guile and Gauche.
  In the context of Snd, it is absurd to have to make sure "pi" is defined all the time.
  It's already defined in Forth, and in Ruby it's PI in the math module.

clm.c: removed (unused) mus_make_frame|mixer_with_data

removed the default font settings in Snd.gtkrc -- presumably Snd
  will now pick up your theme's default font.

added a -nogtkrc startup switch.  This turns off the search for a gtkrc file,
  or its built-in equivalent -- you get whatever your current theme wants.

removed open-sound-file, vct->sound-file, and close-sound-file.  
  These were optimizations that make little sense anymore -- use
  mus-sound-open-output and friends instead.  See snd8.scm for
  backwards compatible replacements.

mix tags use the mix-color now


Checked: sbcl 1.0, 
         lesstif 0.95 (it still doesn't work with Snd -- segfaults, 
           comatose listener, etc), 
         cmucl 19d (dies trying to compile cmn's transpose.lisp, 
           so that file is commented out for this version of cmucl),
         pango 1.15.1|2, fontconfig 2.4.2, cairo 1.2.6, glib 2.12.5|6, stklos 0.82,
         gamin 1.8.0 (this version fixes at least one of the problems
           that would sometimes cause Snd to hang)
