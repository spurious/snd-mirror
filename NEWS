Snd 12.8

s7: added logbit? (using gmp arg order, not CL)

    added reverse argument (in C) to s7_new_type_x and (in scheme) to make-type.  
      This is needed because an object might implement the apply and set methods, 
      but they might refer to different things (I should have noticed this a long
      time ago...)

    s7_environment_to_list and environment->list return just the local environment's
      bindings.  They used to crawl up the environment chain, but that can now be
      done with outer-environment.

    outer-environment returns the environment enclosing its argument (an environment).

    added an object system example in the environments section of s7.html.
      It's based on environments as classes/instances.

checked: sbcl 1.0.55, gtk 3.3.8

Thanks!:
