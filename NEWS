Snd 8.8:

many improvements from Mike

Jack support in OSX and Cygwin from Kjetil

poussin-sum and jackson-sum in dsp.scm (more band-limited pulse-trains), and changed
  amplitude scaling in fejer-sum and legendre-sum so that they always peak at 1.0.
  Also added a note in clm.html showing a way to get a time-varying pulse-train.

changed default-output-data-format to mus-bfloat

removed initFile and the (undocumented) htmlDir X resources

make install now copies the *.scm|fs|rb files to {prefix}/share/snd

added read/write support for Apple's new CAFF (64-bit) audio files

checked: glib 2.12.7|8|9, gtk 2.10.7|8|9, Mesa 6.5.1|2, pango-1.15.3|4|5,
         sbcl 1.0.1|2, fth 1.0.7

Thanks!:  Mike Scholz, Kjetil Matheussen, Meino Christian Cramer, Michael Edwards
