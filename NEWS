Snd 13.0:

Matti Koskinen got s7 working in uclinux on the blackfin processor.

removed run.c and the run macro (34000 lines!). 

removed ptree-channel, max-virtual-ptrees, optimization, 
  optimization-hook, add-clm-field, declare, and all the scheme
  functions that depended on these.

deprecated vct-map! and removed it from the Snd scheme files.

added Save icon to the toolbars

moved the clm/clm2xen struct declarations out of the header files,
  and added accessor functions.  (Bumped clm to 5.0, sndlib to 22.0).

completely changed defgenerator (in s7 it is now based on environments).
  removed def-clm-struct and ws-interrupt.

added mus-mix-with-envs (for fullmix), and oscil-bank.

removed gamin support (ancient libfam replacement, used only in Motif version).

checked: gtk 3.5.6|8

Thanks!:  Matti Koskinen, Mike Scholz
