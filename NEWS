Snd 12.9

  Mike Scholz got Snd to compile/load/run in 
     FreeBSD 8, 9, and 10
     CentOS: gcc (GCC) 4.4.6 20110731 (Red Hat 4.4.6-3) 
     Ubuntu: gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) 4.6.1 
     Debian: gcc (Debian 4.4.5-8) 4.4.5 
     NetBSD
     OpenBSD

  s7: added random-state?, hash-table-iterator?, and morally-equal?

  clm/cmn/snd/s7: removed snd1.html and snd-contents.html (these were
       using Javascript for stuff that is now built into html), and 
       translated the rest of the html files to html5.
  
  snd: removed the recorder, recorder-dialog, snd-g|xrec.c,
       changed various menu names and added a view:with-grid menu
       moved dialog buttons around at random,
       removed save-macros and named keyboard macros,
       added context-sensitive tooltips to the gtk version,
       changed the gtk listener default font to Monospace 11,
       the "minibuffer" is now a "statusbar".  This means it is not 
          editable, so all the key sequences that used to prompt for 
          info are either undefined now, or use a dialog instead.
       removed minibuffer-history-length, prompt-in-minibuffer, clear-minibuffer,
          and report-in-minibuffer.  Replaced the latter two with status-report.
       removed sound-specific search-procedures (i.e. there is only one search procedure)
       removed the bomb function

checked: clang 1.7, gmp 5.0.3, gtk 3.3.14|16

Thanks!: Mike Scholz
