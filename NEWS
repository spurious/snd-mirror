Snd 9.4:

added export-all.scm.

the run macro can now find define* args (from within the define*)

def-clm-struct uses def-optkey-fun for its make func,
  and takes an optional :make-wrapper function to specialize the make function.
  Also run is better at handling lists and def-clm-struct.
  def-clm-struct can include a list of lists of (name func) pairs to implement generic funcs.

added generators.scm with 42 new generators (and a couple instruments under construction)
  several of these generators used to be in dsp.scm (under slightly different names) --
  the old forms are in snd9.scm.

clm: changed asymmetric-fm to use cos(sin) and added amplitude normalization.

make-dpss-window and make-papoulis-window in dsp.scm
  gsl-eigenvectors

added make-mixer! and make-frame! to bypass the size checks (for matrices and vectors)

checked: sbcl 1.0.9|10, pango 1.18.1, gtk 2.12.0

Thanks!: Steven Jones, Todd Ingalls, Achim Bornhoeft
