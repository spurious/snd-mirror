Snd 21.6:

s7.h: added s7_is_random_state, s7_make_normal_vector, s7_array_to_list

s7.c: I changed the default heap size to 64k (half its previous size) --
      my timing tests and benchmarks seem to indicate that this is usually
      faster (perhaps cache-related?).  Pushing it down to 32k doesn't
      affect runtimes very much.  To get the old size back,
      (set! (*s7* 'heap-size) 128000).

Checked: sbcl 2.1.7
