Snd 17.8:

Snd: moved from cvs to svn at sourceforge:
     svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/snd/svn1/trunk snd

s7: added immutable!, immutable?
    define-constant follows normal lexical scoping rules now
    symbol-access renamed symbol-setter
    added third optional argument to the symbol-setter: the relevant environment
    deprecated s7_procedure_with_setter, s7_symbol_access
    renamed let-set!-fallback to let-set-fallback since I never remember the "!"
    renamed procedure-signature -> signature, 
            procedure-documentation -> documentation, 
            procedure-setter -> setter.
      these are all generic, so the "procedure" part is misleading, but
      unfortunately these new names collide with the previous function-local
      variables (for example, documentation accessed by procedure-documentation).  
      Since those variables are normally constants, and since I can't think of
      anything better, they are now of the form +documentation+.  

clm: removed *clm-default-frequency*; Mike fixed the Ruby and Forth cases.

checked: sbcl 1.4.0

Thanks!: Mike Scholz.
