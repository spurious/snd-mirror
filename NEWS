Snd 7.12:

marks.rb, draw.rb, poly.rb, musglyphs.rb, and many other improvements thanks to Mike Scholz.

rt-examples.scm and much else thanks to Kjetil Matheussen.

mixer.scm with various matrix/vector functions (determinant, inverse,
   solve simultaneous linear equations, etc) as applied to mixers/frames.

   mixer-scale is now embedded in mixer* (old name is in snd7.scm), and
   frame*, frame+, mixer*, and mixer+ take either generator or float args.

   changed interpretation of frame->frame arguments.  To get the old style,
      you need to reverse the first two args -- the new style reflects the
      actual matrix multiplication order, which I think makes more sense.

poly.scm with various polynomial-related functions.

added before-save-state-hook and y-axis-label.

moved load-font from C to snd-motif.scm and snd-gtk.scm.

removed xen->sample generator.

changed mus-error-to-string to mus-error-type->string.
    moved mus-data-format->string and mus-header-type->string from ws.scm to C.

changed moog.scm and prc95.scm to use def-clm-struct, rather than a list.
    zip.scm (zipper) changed (takes env args now, not thunks, uses def-clm-struct, etc).

added invert-filter and volterra-filter in dsp.scm (also src-duration, for convenience)


CLM: removed bessel.lisp -- it was very much out of date, and much of it is
       now available directly from libm (see note about bes-j0 etc in 7.11)

     added size arg (buffer size) to make-readin, make-file->sample, make-file->frame

     fullmix.ins defaults changed.


checked: gtk 2.6.5|6|7
