Snd 14.6

s7: gensym? environment*

clm: even|odd-weight|multiple (new built-in functions).
     moving-norm (new generator).

   deprecate frame and mixer generators -- use float vectors instead.

   finally deprecate sound-data objects -- this includes a bunch of
      functions such as dac-hook, mus-sound-read, etc.

   "frample" replaces "frame" wherever "frame" refers to
      a set of samples that represent a single sampling instant
      (also known as a "sample frame").  So, the generator once
      known as "file->frame" is now "file->frample".

    mus-mix -> mus-file-mix, 
    mus-mix-with-envs -> mus-file-mix-with-envs.

CL clm: bumped version number to 5 (I'll leave clm-4.tar.gz
    for future generations to marvel at).  The new CL clm
    does not have frames or mixers, and has file->frample
    and frample->file in place of file->frame and frame->file.
    Also sound-frames -> sound-framples and so on.

Some notes on updating:
  the main instruments that changed are expandn, freeverb, and fullmix
  
  mixer -> 1-dim array of floats, size: chans * chans
  frame -> same, size: chans
  sound-data -> 2 dim array of floats, size: '(chans samples-per-chan)
  array of floats = float-vector in scheme, double-array in CL, vct elsewhere
  
  "frame" -> "frample" in most cases, including mus-file-mix arg names
  envs arg to mus-file-mix-with-envs has same layout as matrix arg
  frample->frample arg order is '(matrix in-vector out-vector)
  most mus-sound-read|write cases can be replaced by array->file and file->array
