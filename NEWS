Snd 15.8:

changed make-iterator with a closure argument -- the closure
  is now called without any arguments, and the it should
  contain a variable named 'iterator? with a non-false value.

s7 now calls setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C") at startup.

What used to be called the run macro (clm optimizer) has been
  completely rewritten for about the sixth time; many changes
  in s7.h, etc. 

  1990: CL version (from Mus10 from MusicN)
  1993: CL + FFI
  1994: CL->C
  2002: Guile+Snd run macro
  2008: s7+sndlib
  2015: This time for sure!

  This change is about 1/3 complete, so view this version of
  Snd with grave suspicion.  

checked: gtk 3.17.4|5, sbcl 1.2.13
