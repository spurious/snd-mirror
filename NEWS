Snd 9.11

more RT improvements from Kjetil

with-threaded-sound (ws.scm and sound.lisp), support in Snd/CLM for threads.
with-threaded-channels (extensions.scm)
  (these are still in the "alpha" stage, but bug reports are always welcome)

changed arguments to the progress-report funcs (need channel-specific
  widgetry for multi-thread possibilities)

1 more generator in generators.scm

axis-color (to set the axis color in combined graphs)

time-graph-hook (to set data colors in combined graphs)

flatten-partials (avoid spikey waveforms)

mus-max-malloc, mus-max-table-size, *clm-file-buffer-size* can be a bignum (off_t)
  (support in Snd/CLM for off_t sized arrays)

output-safety arg to with-sound, mus-safety method --
   part of trying to get full speed from multicore machines.


checked: gtk 2.13.2|3|4, ruby 1.8.7, clisp 2.46, sbcl 1.0.18


Thanks!: Kjetil, Mike
