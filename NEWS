Snd 8.1

added a bunch of Forth files (*.fs) thanks to Mike Scholz. 

many more improvements from Kjetil and Mike.

Gauche support in Snd -- this is a Scheme extension language like Guile.

     http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/gauche/index.html

  use --with-gauche in configure.  There are a number of small differences
  between Gauche and Guile.  

    added gauche-optargs.scm to get define* (but not defmacro*)
          gauche-format.scm to get ~{ and others, but it's semi-broken
          block comments in '#| |#' to the Guile Snd to be compatible with Gauche (and CL).  
    removed ws-interrupt? arg (no defmacro* currently in Gauche version).
    added define+ and definstrument+ to get around lack of documentation string support in Gauche.
    changed all '#! !#' to "#| |#'
    changed all '#:' to ':'
    "run" is a no-op in Gauche -- local variables aren't (currently) accessible in this context.

clisp support in clm.  Due to Clisp's way of macroexpanding "loop", the
  loop macro can't be used within "run" (this affects Clisp users only of course).  
  I changed a bunch of such cases to use "do". Also, "run*" doesn't currently work in
  the Clisp clm.

changed show-listener slightly; if optional arg is #f, listener is not created.

removed envelope-base.

clm-load (ws.scm) for cm.

checked: sbcl 0.9.11|12, gsl 1.8, gtk 2.8.17, fftw 3.1.1, fth up to 0.8.16

with much help from: Michael Klingbeil, Kjetil, Mike.
