Snd 9.9

more rt and faust-related improvements thanks to Kjetil Matheussen

freeverb bugfix thanks to Oded Ben-Tal.

rmsp.ins replaced by track-rms.ins thanks to Michael Edwards.

many Ruby and Forth-related improvements, and a bugfix in graphEq thanks to Mike.

most of my effort went into the documentation.

selection.scm (with various functions that used to be in examp.scm, extensions.scm etc)

with-marked-sound, with-mixed-sound and with-mixed-sound->notelist (ws.scm)

3 more generators in generators.scm

bess.scm can now be loaded into Snd (as well as run independently as a script)

checked: gsl 1.10, autoconf 2.62, cairo 1.6.4, sbcl 1.0.16

Thanks!: Kjetil Matheussen, Oded Ben-Tal, Michael Edwards, Mike Scholz, Rick Taube.
