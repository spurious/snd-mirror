Snd 13.0:

Matti Koskinen got s7 working in uclinux on the blackfin processor.

removed run.c and the run macro (34000 lines!). 

removed ptree-channel, max-virtual-ptrees, optimization, 
  optimization-hook, add-clm-field, declare, and all the scheme
  functions that depended on these.

deprecated vct-map! and removed it from the Snd scheme files.
removed trailing with-source arg from display-edits.

added Save icon to the toolbars

moved the clm/clm2xen struct declarations out of the header files,
  and added accessor functions.  (Bumped clm to 5.0, sndlib to 22.0).

added mus_make_generator, mus_make_generator_type, mus_xen_gen
  (moved parts of defgenerator to C).  removed def-clm-struct.

checked: gtk 3.5.6

Thanks!:  Matti Koskinen, Mike Scholz
