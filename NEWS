Snd 19.1

in s7, replaced morally-equal? with equivalent?
       format with the control-string as the first argument is now an error
         (I can't remember why I made the port optional)

clm2xen.c: fixed an error message in partials->polynomial (it thought
  an integer was not a number), and a mus-length optimization bug.

checked: sbcl-1.14.16

Thanks!: Nando.
