Snd 8.3

CLM generators: 
  added filtered-comb ("fcomb" for freeverb)
  added move-sound (runtime portion of dlocsig)
  renamed average generator to moving-average
  renamed windowed-maxamp to moving-max (dsp.scm)
  added moving-rms, moving-sum, moving-length (dsp.scm)
     overlay-rms-env (draw.scm) uses moving-rms
     Perhaps these should be built-in CLM generators.
  mfilter (dsp.scm) -- Mathews/Smith high-Q filter 
    (similar to formant; another version is maxf.scm/ins)
  removed make-ppolar|zpolar (use make-two-pole|zero)
  moved ssb-fm and rmsgain.scm code to clm-ins.scm (removed rmgain.scm)
  locsig now returns a float (not a frame)

dlocsig.scm (translation to Scheme of Fernando's dlocsig.lisp)
  in CL-CLM, dlocsig.lisp and move-sound.ins now use the move-sound generator.
  mix-move-sound (extsnd.html)

green.scm (bounded brownian noise, from CLM's green.cl)

snd8.scm (backwards compatibility stuff for snd 8)

shepard-tone (sndscm.html)
agc (dsp.scm)
with-full-sound (ws.scm)
def-clm-float-struct (CL-CLM only)
fir+comb (clm.html)
removed vct-map

g_signal_connect and other such macros, and gtk_print_operation* to xg.c

merged new-icons.scm into new-buttons.scm and renamed the latter toolbar.scm
  toolbar.scm also works in gtk
