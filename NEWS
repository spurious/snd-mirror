Snd 9.0

I discarded the old recorder and the track support, and completely 
revamped the virtual mix support -- enough changes to warrant a new 
major version.


the recorder:
  completely discarded the old recorder and its functions -- these are gone:
    recorder-autoload
    recorder-buffer-size
    recorder-file
    recorder-file-hook
    recorder-gain
    recorder-in-amp
    recorder-in-chans
    recorder-in-data-format
    recorder-in-device
    recorder-max-duration
    recorder-out-amp
    recorder-out-chans
    recorder-out-data-format
    recorder-out-header-type
    recorder-srate
    recorder-trigger
    vu-in-dB
    vu-size
  due to hardware troubles, I haven't fully tested the new recorder.

tracks:
  removed:             replacement:
    copy-track

    make-track-frame-reader 
    make-track-sample-reader
    mix-track

    read-track-frame 
    read-track-sample
    retempo-track         scale-tempo
    reverse-track         scale-tempo by a negative scaler
    save-track            save-mixes
    set-all-tracks
    track                 (now any list of mix ids)
    track->sound-data     (see save-mixes)
    track->vct            (see save-mixes)
    track-amp             scale-mixes
    track-amp-env         env-mixes
    track-chans
    track-color           color-mixes
    track-dialog-track
    track-frames          mixes-length
    track-maxamp          mixes-maxamp
    track-name
    track-position        move-mixes
    track-property
    track-sample-reader?
    track-speed           src-mixes
    track-speed-style
    track-tag-y           set-mixes-tag-y
    track-tempo           scale-tempo
    track-track
    track?                (now just a list)
    tracks
    transpose-track       transpose-mixes
    view-tracks-dialog

  removed track-colors.scm and mix-menu.scm

  removed all track-related arguments from functions such as mix-vct, mix, and
    mix-region

  removed tempo-control-bounds

  completely rewrote the virtual mix support:  these are gone:
    copy-mix
    delete-mix (set mix-amp to 0.0)
    mix-chans (each mix is one chan in -> one chan out)
    mix-inverted?
    mix-locked?
    mix-speed-style
    mix-tag-position
    pan-mix (mix.scm) and all its friends

  changed
    mix-frames -> mix-length
    delete-all-mixes -> silence-all-mixes
 
  added 
    edit-properties
    mix-sync

  moved mix-properties into C.

  "mix" function now handles one channel in and out and the position defaults to 0 (not the cursor)
