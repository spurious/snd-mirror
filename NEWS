Snd 18.2:

s7: added +nan.0 and +inf.0 to be compatible with other schemes
    +iterator+ now instead of iterator? for closure-as-iterator
    deprecated the s7_ulong and s7_ulong_long functions.

Marty Hayman got libgtk_s7.c to work in gtkex.c.

checked: sbcl 1.4.5 (in linux)

Thanks!: Marty Hayman
