Snd 11.14

   removed c-g! function; it can be replaced by stop-playing.
     removed c-g? in scheme -- it is superfluous.

   selection has a loop play triangle
   mix and cursor have play triangles
   if mouse click = play, the cursor is a right or left arrow.
   removed draggable mark play triangle and mark-drag-triangle-hook.
   added variable play-arrow-size (default: 10)
   added Edit:Unselect menu option

   added 'src' and 'auto' buttons to the Save-as dialogs for automatic srate conversion
    and a blog-style commentary.  In the extension language, these are
    save-as-dialog-src and save-as-dialog-auto-comment.

   added sync-style variable: sync-none, sync-all, or sync-by-sound (now the default).
     this used to be handled in extensions.* under names like global-sync-choice.
     sync-none was the previous default. examp.scm sync-all function renamed sync-everything.

   moved with-reopen-menu to snd11.scm, and removed it from the preferences dialog
     This menu is almost the same as the built-in File:Open recent menu.

   moved make-hidden-controls-dialog from snd-motif|gtk.scm to snd11.scm, and removed it 
     from the preferences dialog.  It is now built-in as Options:Controls
  
   moved show-selection from extensions.* to C, added unselect-all (in C)
     which replaces clear-selection (selection.scm).

   added show-full-duration, initial-beg, initial-dur, ask-about-unsaved-edits,
     with-toolbar, remember-sound-state, with-smpte-label.  removed old
     show-smpte-label in *.scm.

   remember-sound-state in extensions has been moved to C (old scheme code is in snd11.scm).
     it now reads/writes a file named "remembered-<soundfile-name>.scm|fs|rb" where
     <soundfile-name> is the current sound's file name.

   with-toolbar defaults to true in gtk, false otherwise.  It replaces toolbar.scm
     and panic.scm.  Also with-tooltips to turn tooltips on or off.

   The built-in popup menus are now context sensitive, and the files popup.scm
     and gtk-popup.scm have been removed.  Also removed the misc.scm popup menu
     references.

   removed Snd.gtkrc, Snd.ad, and the obsolete X resources stuff.
   added with-menu-icons (gtk only).
   added optional "alpha" arg to make-color.
   moved delete-selection-and-smooth selection.scm into C.
   added delete-samples-and-smooth.


   The Gtk Snd now needs Gtk 2.12 or later.

checked: sbcl 1.0.46, gtk 3.0.1, mpc 0.9
