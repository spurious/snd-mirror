Snd 10.2

added osc.scm thanks to Kjetil.

many improvements thanks to Mike and Rick.

removed Gauche support.

moved the run macro from snd-run.c to run.c and put it in sndlib.

removed s7-format.scm -- format is now built-in.

removed s7-optargs.scm -- define* is also built-in.  The main 
  difference between the two versions of define* is that the
  s7 version does not (currently anyway) accept expressions
  as default values.

checked: gtk 2.14.4|5, clisp 2.47, sbcl 1.0.22, fftw 3.2

Thanks!: Rick, Kjetil, Meino Cramer, Mike Scholz, David Lowenfels,
	 Hayahiko Moro.
