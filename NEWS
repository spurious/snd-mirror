Snd 12.5

This version involves primarily s7 optimizations.  About half the
  standard clm instruments now run nearly as fast without the run
  macro as with it.  Progress has been slow...

in clm, the function output option in out* and in* has been removed.
        added mus-type

checked: sbcl 1.0.51, gtk 3.1.16|18|90|92 3.2.0, ruby 1.9.3

Thanks!: Mike Scholz, Brooke Mitchell
