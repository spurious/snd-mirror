Snd 11.5

autoload support via s7's *unbound-variable-hook*.  If you try to
  use some undefined function, Snd first looks through a table
  of (nearly) everything defined in the scheme files that come 
  with Snd, loading the needed files automatically. To turn this 
  off, (set! *unbound-variable-hook* #f).

removed encapsulation from s7.  Added augment-environment.

added make-type to s7: scheme-level type creation.
      symbol-access: trap/modify the symbol value lookup mechanism.

mix-notelists in ws.scm.

checked: gtk 2.20.0, sbcl 1.0.37
