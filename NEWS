Snd 14.2:

added *show-indices* etc (the old procedure-with-setter globals 
  can now be accessed as normal variables -- there are about
  200 of them).

with-tracking-cursor changed again! (added :track-and-stay to
  make the cursor stay where the play stops).

removed (obsolete) trap-segfault.

s7: bignum-precision is now a variable: *bignum-precision*.
    added *maximum-stack-size* to catch infinite recursion.

checked: gtk 3.10.2|11.0|2, OSX 10.9, sbcl 1.1.13

Thanks!: Ray Rashif, Robert Komar
