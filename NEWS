Snd 7.11

  Mike Scholz greatly expanded and improved the Ruby stuff in Snd (not to mention
    many other general improvements): snd_test.rb replaced by snd-test.rb, 
    new files mix.rb, dsp.rb, pvoc.rb -- an amazing addition to Snd!

  Kjetil Matheussen implemented real-time support!  The new files are
    oo.scm, rt-compiler.scm, and rt-engine.scm -- another amazing addition!

  delay and move-locsig bugfixes thanks to Fernando.

  changed libxm to libxg in gtk case, also xm-version to xg-version
    added --with-static-xg configure option (same as --with-static-xm)

  added the -export-dynamic loader switch if using Gnu's ld and dlfcn

  band limited sawtooth in dsp.scm (Stilson/Smith/Kritov)

  bes-j0|1|n, bes-y0|1|n, bes-i0, erf|c, lgamma (etc from libm)

  mus-interpolate

  env-channel-with-base

  Ruby side of edit-list->function

  zoom-focus-style can be a function

  polyshape generator (polynomial + oscil)

  mus-chebyshev-first|second-kind (as "kind" arg to partials->polynomial)

  partials->waveshape no longer normalizes the partials (to parallel partials->polynomial)

  gc-off and gc-on are no-ops now in Guile -- the underlying support was 
    removed in the CVS Guile


in CMN: Anders Vinjar fixed a bug in display-crescendo

        removed obsolete make-cmn.cl


in CLM: Rick fixed a bug in play

        run* cleaned-up finally

        ffi cleaned-up (removed various obsolete linkages)

        removed ACL 4.n support

        sbcl can now handle multi-instrument files and no longer uses the *.sbcl kludge
