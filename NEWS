Snd 13.8.

s7: added autoload (actually moved it from Snd to s7).
    ffitest.c


Snd: listener-colorized, syntax highlighting in glistener.
     colorizer-colors.

     removed the view files dialog from the gtk version, including all the
       related extension language functions, and view-files-select-hook.

     The various file open/save dialogs now (sigh) use gtk's filechooser.

     the file-sorter functions now apply only to the Motif case.


cmn: Lispworks port thanks to Anders Vinjar.
clm: sbcl bugfix thanks to Michael Edwards.

checked: gtk 3.9.2, sbcl 1.1.8, openbsd 5.3 and FC 19 (via VirtualBox)

Thanks!: Victor Gerasimov, Mike Scholz, Anders Vinjar, Michael Edwards, Rick Taube.
