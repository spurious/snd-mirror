Snd 7.15

removed yes-or-no? with associated dialog (and snd-g|xerror.c)
        old Mac OS (8 or 9) support (old-mac-audio.c has the code), also MPW C
          (this affects CLM as well)

added clear-minibuffer
      optional as-error arg to report-in-minibuffer
      sound-file-extensions as settable list
      before-exit|close-hook
      -init startup switch to set init filename as arg
      netBSD audio support

File:Mix dialog no longer exits upon "mix" (removed keep-mix-dialog-open-upon-ok from snd-motif.scm)
File:Insert menu item and dialog added, also insert-file-dialog
read/write support OGG, Speex, and Flac files (via File:Save as)
read support for Mpeg and Midi

gtk version no longer defaults to happy button colors -- they clash with the fancy icons.
  as long as I was changing colors, I changed to an "autumnal" theme for the Motif side.

View:Files dialog completely recast:
  removed current files list, added various ways to use the selected file(s) in the other list
  previous-files-* -> view-files-* (sort, select-hook)
  removed previous-files-sort-procedure
  added sort-files-by-name|size|date|entry
  added view-files-amp|speed|amp-env|speed-style|files|selected-files
  click of file name no longer opens that file -- it just adds it to the selected files list for the dialog
  view-files-select-hook return type no longer matters, and args are: dialog file-name
  preload-directory -> add-directory-to-view-files-list
  preload-file -> add-file-to-view-files-list
  optional dialog arg to view-files-sort (local set)

added osx-10.4-snd at ccrma-ftp

_sndlib.h is now an internal header, whereas sndlib.h is intended for programs
  that use sndlib -- this is an attempt to reduce name-space collisions by
  sequestering configuration info.

checked: OSX 10.4 (gtk/motif/guile/ruby), gtk 2.7.3|4|5, gtk 2.8.0|1|2, NetBSD 2.0, 
  Solaris 10 (x86 audio is broken), sbcl 0.9.3
