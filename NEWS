Snd 17.0.

Tito Latini fixed many bugs, especially in save-state and snd-mix, 
  and made it possible to move dialogs between desktops in Motif.

Mike Scholz updated snd-test.fs|rb and made clm.rb compatible
  with the latest Ruby.

checked: gtk 3.22.2|3|4, gtk 3.89.1, sbcl 1.3.11|12.

Thanks!: Mike Scholz, Anders Vinjar, Tito Latini, Kjetil Matheussen,
