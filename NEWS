Snd 14.0

added --with-readline to the configure script

in s7: make-shared-vector, homogenous int and float vectors
         sound-data and vct (the types) are now just synonyms for vector
         (this is step 3 of the guile->s7 plan from 2008)
         dac-hook data is now a list of float vectors

       ~W in format, :readable as third arg of object->string
         write.scm: pretty-print, checkpoint (removed pretty-print.scm).

       WITH_MAIN compiler flag to include a main program in s7.c (a REPL).

       libc.scm (bindings to most of libc)
       libgsl.scm (bindings for some of GSL)

       reader-expand and reader-cond -- read-time choices (#+ analogs)

removed oscope.scm and sound-data->sound-data
removed kmenu.scm (obsolete)

Checked: gtk 3.9.12|14, sbcl 1.1.11

Thanks!:  Rick Taube, James Hearon
