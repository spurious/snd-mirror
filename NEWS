Snd 11.9.

The new gtk (version 3) has discarded most of the gdk functions, replacing them
  with cairo.  This means the xg module and gtk code have also
  changed a lot.  --with-cairo is the default (and the only alternative).
  You'll need gtk 2.9 or later, and cairo 1.6.4 or later.  Eventually
  there will be a cairo "surface" for openGL, so I'll be able to
  reimplement that connection.  

kmenu.scm uses the new gdk key names, so it only works in gtk 2.90.7 or later.

removed --with-builtin-gtkrc (Gtk themes have improved a lot over the years)

removed --with-static-gsl

removed the button color functions.
  
added a play triangle to the selection, and a close button to the sound pane.

changed the default value of just-sounds to #t.

s7: :allow-other-keys in define* parameter list.

Greg Santucci noticed and fixed a bug in *trace-hook*.

checked: gtk 2.90.6|7, sbcl 1.0.42

Thanks!: Michael Klingbeil, Greg Santucci
