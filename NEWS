Snd 7.5

snd-hobbit.scm from Kjetil -- support for the Hobbit Scheme compiler in Snd!
  gtk support in fft-menu.scm (and many other improvements) thanks to Kjetil

Steve Sykes got Snd to run in Cygwin/Windows (with Guile and Motif)!

configure switch --with-doc-dir (for gentoo)
  also new variables GUILE_CONFIG_name and GUILE_name (for OSX/fink)

The Snd/sndlib/CLM build process now requires configure -> config.h.
  for the case of CLM on the old Mac (OS9 etc),  it might work to just 
    make an empty file named config.h
  in the CL CLM, you can force configure to run with the *feature* #+reconfigure

removed stop-playing-region-hook, stop-playing-channel-hook, before-apply-hook
  added stop-function arg to play, play-and-wait, play-selection, play-region, add-player
  cursor-update-interval (tracking cursor redraw rate if it is tracking the DAC)
  cursor-location-offset (tracking cursor position fixup)

added add-colormap, delete-colormap, colormap-size, colormap-name, changed colormap-ref
  removed 2 previously built-in colormaps, added rainbow colormap
  default colormap is 0 (black and white)
  new error: 'no-such-colormap

ssb-am generator in CLM
  ssb-bank (dsp.scm) for pitch/duration changes, ssb-bank-env to add freq env
  ssb-fm
  distribution arg to make-rand, make-rand-interp
  removed mus-x*|y*|a*|b*, replaced by mus-x|ycoeff

periodogram in dsp.scm
  edot-product (clm.c) (for DFT-related stuff like stretch-sound-via-dft)
  read-ascii (examp.scm) (raw text as sound file data format)
  complex number support in xen (xen.h) (in Guile -- I don't think Ruby has complex numbers)

checked: cmucl 19a, gtk 2.4.2|3, sbcl 0.8.11

With much help from: Kjetil S. Matheussen, Anders Vinjar, Michael Edwards,
