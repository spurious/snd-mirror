Snd 10.9

Kjetil improved the rt stuff.
added env.scm to sndlib (for jcvoi.scm).
optimization now defaults to 6.
show-backtrace removed.

s7: *error-info* for better error reporting. 
    vector-for-each, vector-map, string-for-each
    generic map, for-each

added s7-slib-init.scm: slib support.  It assumes getenv, file-exists?, and system
  are provided elsewhere (this is the case if s7 is running in Snd or sndlib).

added s7.html
  s7: with-environment, true multiple-values, vectors can have > 2^31 elements (you'll 
      need a lot of memory).  multiple-value-bind and multiple-value-set!.

checked:  gtk 2.17.7|8|9|10|11, guile 1.9.2|3, sbcl 1.0.31, gsl 1.13

  in sbcl, something has changed in the double float array handling, so functions
  like convolution can't be called from lisp.  The instruments seem to be ok.
  (The two use the same calling sequence so I'm a bit mystified).

Thanks!: Rick Taube, Ralf Mattes, Kjetil Matheussen, Mike Scholz
