Snd 15.5:

repl.scm to replace use of readline in various cases.  The main one is
  Snd without a GUI.  In this case, you need to tell Snd where to find
  repl.scm.  In my ~/.snd_s7 file, I have:

  (set! *load-path* (cons "/home/bil/cl" *load-path*))

  I think you can build this into Snd by using the SCRIPTS_DIR flag
  in the makefile.


checked: sbcl 1.2.9|10, gtk 3.15.10|11|12, 3.16.0
