Snd 11.4

most of my effort in this version went into optimizations.

the (sndlib) run macro's argument no longer has to be a "thunk".

removed weird r4rs macro syntax from s7.

I think I'll have to either rename or remove the encapsulation stuff
  in s7.  It turns out that very similar names are being used in the Kernel
  language and the r7rs discussions, and my use can only cause confusion.  
  Let me know if you're using that stuff.


checked: gtk 2.19.6|7, sbcl 1.0.36, gsl 1.14
