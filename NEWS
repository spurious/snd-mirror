Snd 10.3

Kjetil made improvements to the rt stuff.

Michael Gogins and Rick figured out how to build sndlib in windows --
  I hope I correctly incorporated their changes in the configure script.


added multiprecision math support for all scheme (s7) numeric
  types and functions via gmp, mpfr, and mpc.  In configure,
  use the --with-gmp switch.  bignum-precision can set the
  float precision (default is 128 bits).  If this all works
  out, I'll add this support to clm as well.  You'll need
  mpc 0.5.2 (the latest version).

sox header support.

jcvoi.scm (translated from jcvoi.ins) for the immortal Old Macdonald.

the sine-summation, sum-of-cosines, and sum-of-sines generators are deprecated.
  Their replacements are nrxysin (or nrsin), ncos, and nsin.
  snd10.scm has backwards-compatible definitions of these generators.

removed event.scm and all the xm.c stuff that was deprecated in 2002.

sin-m*pi/n and show-digits-of-pi-starting-from functions in numerics.scm


checked: Gamin 0.1.10, sbcl 1.0.23|24, Guile 1.8.6, gtk 2.14.6|2.15.0
