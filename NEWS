Snd 8.6

many improvements from Mike.

mix/track mechanism sped up by about a factor of 100, so its possible
  to have thousands of each (but the screeen gets very cluttered).

  added mix-name, track-name, track-tag-y, mix-name->id, and track-name->id
  to help navigate in these situations.


out-any, in-any, locsig, move-sound, and friends can now handle vct and sound-data objects
  as the "stream" argument.  In with-sound, this is the *output* variable or :output 
  argument which then applies to all notes. So, with-sound can be used in a zillion new ways:

     (vct-scale! (with-temp-sound (:output (make-vct 2210)) (fm-violin 0 .1 440 .1)) 2.0)

  This extension caused changes in sound-data object handling:
    sound-data-scale! (for with-sound writing to a sound-data object and with the
      :scaled-to or :scaled-by arguments)
    sound-data-fill! (also for with-sound if not :continue-old-file)

  fade.scm instruments changed to use outa rather than vct-map!
  moved samples->sound-data to snd8.scm.
  Mike provided sndins support for this change.


rf64 headers and mutable riff for very large output files.

mus-float-equal-fudge-factor (mainly for reasonable generator equal? checks)

->frequency, ->samples (ws.scm) for things like (violin 0 .1 'e4).

channel-clipped? in examp.scm

filter-fft in examp.scm.

checked: Fedora Core 6, sbcl 0.9.18, fth 1.0.0, Gauche 0.8.8, autoconf 2.61
