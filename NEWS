Snd 19.0

s7: added (*s7* 'history-enabled) at Kjetil's suggestion.
    deprecated s7_gc_unprotect (use s7_gc_unprotect_at).
    added weak-hash-table

The main visible s7 change:

hash-table* is now hash-table, and the old hash-table is gone.
This code can provide backwards compatibility except for some
corner cases involving map and for-each:

(when (string>=? (s7-version) "8.0") 
  (define hash-table* hash-table) 
  (define (hash-table . args) 
    (apply hash-table* (map (lambda (x) 
			      (values (car x) (cdr x)))
			    args))))


checked: sbcl 1.4.14|15
