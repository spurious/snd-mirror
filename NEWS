7 more generators in generators.scm, moved green.scm to generators.scm,
  moving moving-* from dsp.scm to generators.scm (and moved smoothing-filter
  to snd9.scm).

retired the waveshape generator finally (see generators.scm for replacement).

added chebyshev-t-sum, chebyshev-u-sum, and chebyshev-tu-sum using the 
  recursive version of the Tn and Un calculations.  Used by the polyoid 
  and noid generators in generators.scm to compute peak-phases.scm.

4 more birds in animals.scm

normalize-partials is now built-in (mus_normalize_partials in clm.c)

music5 port: music5.f, music5-examples, old-music5.f
