     Debian: gcc (Debian 4.4.5-8) 4.4.5 
     NetBSD
     OpenBSD

  s7: added random-state?, hash-table-iterator?, and morally-equal?

  clm/cmn/snd/s7: removed snd1.html and snd-contents.html (these were
       using Javascript for stuff that is now built into html), and 
       translated the rest of the html files to html5.
  
  snd: removed the recorder, recorder-dialog, snd-g|xrec.c,
       changed various menu names and added a view:with-grid menu
       moved dialog buttons around at random,
       removed minibuffer-history-length, prompt-in-minibuffer,
       removed save-macros and named keyboard macros,
       added context-sensitive tooltips to the gtk version,
       changed the gtk listener default font to Monospace 11,



checked: clang 1.7, gmp 5.0.3, gtk 3.3.14|16
