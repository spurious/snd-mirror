<b>Closing Remarks And Acknowledgements</b> 
<p>

I hope you've enjoyed this article. Above all I hope you actually tried using Snd with its latest enhancements on some files of your own. I welcome any feedback, particularly with suggestions for improving the interface components and corrections to parameter definitions.
<p>

Snd is rich in editing, processing, mixing, and synthesis capabilities, and the customization of Snd is an on-going process. The addition of GUI widgets and popup menus has contributed greatly to the new Snd's ease of use, but much of Snd's power remains to be revealed to the non-programming user. Work on improving Snd's interface will continue, and the interested reader is advised to join the Snd mail-list to stay current with its latest developments (see the Snd home page for details). 
<p>

I would like to thank the many respondents to my query regarding Cool Edit on the mail lists for Csound, the Linux Audio Developers group, and the "Common" software packages. Their responses formed the core around which my customization of Snd took shape, and I am truly in their debt. I must also thank Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano for his assistance in resolving my problems with ALSA and Snd. But by far the greatest thanks goes to Snd author Bill Schottstaedt. He endured a nearly unceasing flow of questions and requests during the writing of this article, and he provided nearly all the tools needed to create the Snd presented in this article.
