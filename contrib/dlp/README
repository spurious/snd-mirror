Explicit load path settings are no longer required for any of these files. However, you must place the following lines in your ~/.snd file:

	(set! %load-path (cons "/your/path/to/snd-5" %load-path))
	(set! %load-path (cons "/your/path/to/snd-5/contrib/dlp" %load-path))
	(set! snd-remember-paths #t)

(The second line is not strictly required.)

The load-path settings can include any number of specified paths. For example, my .snd begins with thse lines:

	(set! %load-path (cons "/home/dlphilp/my_scm" %load-path))
	(set! %load-path (cons "/home/dlphilp/snd-5" %load-path))
	(set! snd-remember-paths #t)

(The path to my_scm is where I keep the originals for the snd/contrib/dlp directory.)

To enable these modules you can either start Snd with this command sequence (adding the path to your Scheme modules of course) :

	snd -l misc.scm

or you can load the file while Snd is running with this sequence in the Listener:

	(load "misc.scm")

I usually start up Snd with this line:

	snd -l ~/my_scm/misc.scm -geometry 1280x700

for a big view on a 19" monitor. Adjust to taste... 

Also be aware that you must compile Snd for Motif and LADSPA support. I build Snd with the following options:

	./configure --with-motif --with-ladspa --with-static-xm --with-alsa --with-temp-dir=/usr/local/dump/snd-stuff --with-save-dir=/usr/local/dump/snd-stuff

Please corrections, emendations, suggestions, and so forth to dlphilp@bright.net.

Enjoy !
