The following files require explicit load path settings:

	misc.scm
	mix-menu.scm
	new-buttons.scm

Alternately you can specify Snd's module load path, but I haven't quite figured it out...

To enable these modules you can either start Snd with this command sequence (adding the path to your Scheme modules of course) :

	snd -l misc.scm

or you can load the file while Snd is running with this sequence in the Listener:

	(load "misc.scm")

I usually start up Snd with this line:

	snd -l ~/my_scm/misc.scm -geometry 1280x700

for a big view on a 19" monitor. Adjust to taste...
