SETTING THE MODULE LOAD PATH

Snd will load Scheme files according to the path settings in your $HOME/.snd file. The entry in my own .snd file looks like this:

	(set! %load-path (cons "/home/dlphilp/my_scm" %load-path))
	(set! %load-path (cons "/home/dlphilp/snd-5" %load-path))
	(set! snd-remember-paths #t)

	(load-from-path "misc.scm")

Scheme modules located in those load paths are then available for use.

ABOUT THE LADSPA PLUGINS

I have used the LADSPA plugins as standalone effects processing modules, i.e., there is no mechanism in Snd yet to dynamically load and unload plugins of any type.

The Help texts for the LADSPA effects are courtesy Steve Harris, with edits and emendations from yours truly.
